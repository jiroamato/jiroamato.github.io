My journey towards this career shift began during my time as an Investment Analyst in Web3, where I discovered my passion for data as I honed my skills in data analytics and critical thinking to evaluate startups, make investment decisions, and assess market trends.\nDuring my role as an Investment Analyst, my interest in Machine Learning was also ignited through seeing many firms leverage ML models in research and in practice through Algorithmic Trading. Combined with a background in finance and tech sales, I believe I can bridge the gap between technical analysis and business insight.\nWhat excites me is the nascent landscape of Data Science which means that there is a lot to be done in terms of research and innovation in all domains. Let’s uncover the stories in your data and transform insights into impactful actions."
