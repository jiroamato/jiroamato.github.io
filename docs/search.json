    "text": "Hair loss is very common. 25% percent of men will start experiencing some hair loss before age 21 and two-thirds of men will experience noticeable hair loss before age 35. For women, 12% experience hair loss in their 20s, while 50% of women experience hair loss over their lifetime. With many people being affected, it’s no surprise that the hair loss treatment industry is estimated to be worth three billion dollars today.\nWe see shelves full of hair-loss treatment products in pharmacies with the most popular being minoxidil or more commonly known as Rogaine. Minoxidil is over-the-counter, heavily advertised and is the product that most people use when they experience hair loss. Despite it’s popularity however, it is not the most effective treatment.\nA recent study that combined 33 clinical trials ranked hair loss treatments. The study used a method called network meta-analysis, which allows the comparison of treatments even if they were not tested directly. The results showed dutasteride as the most effective with an effectiveness score of 96.3%. Finasteride ranked second with a score of 87.1%. Minoxidil (Rogaine) ranked third with a score of 52.4%.\nThis makes sense if we consider that pattern baldness is driven by a hormone called DHT. Dutasteride reduces DHT by about 92% and finasteride reduces DHT by about 73%. Minoxidil works differently in that it increases blood flow to the hair follicles, which helps but does not address the root cause of the problem.\nThe study also found that oral medications are more effective than topical medication of the same drug (the case with topical finasteride), which is another reason why topical medicines are note as effective as advertised.\nAlthough not the most effective treatment, minoxidil is still heavily advertised. This is mainly due of its accessibility. Because minoxidil is over-the-counter, companies are able to directly market to consumers. To compare, dutasteride and finasteride have to be prescribed and so are not advertised to the same degree which makes it harder to buy/become informed about. The result is a gap between what’s most marketed and what’s most effective.\nFor anyone considering treatment, the takeaway is simple. The products that you see advertised most aren’t necessarily the most effective. Having a conversation with a doctor about your options, especially prescription options like dutasteride or finasteride, might be worth the effort if you’re serious about results. This is not medical advice.\n\nReferences\n[1] American Hair Loss Association. (n.d.). Men’s Hair Loss: Introduction. https://www.americanhairloss.org/men_hair_loss/introduction.html\n[2] Ho, C.

If we know how Treatment A compares to a placebo, and how Treatment B compares to that same placebo, we can estimate how A and B compare to each other.\nLet’s make this concrete with numbers.\nSuppose Study 1 finds that finasteride increases hair count by 15 hairs/cm² compared to placebo and Study 2 finds that minoxidil increases hair count by 12 hairs/cm² compared to placebo.\nIn this case, finasteride and minoxidil were never tested head-to-head. However, we can still infer that finasteride is roughly 3 hairs/cm² more effective (15 - 12 = 3).\nThis is called an indirect comparison. The placebo serves as the common comparator which acts as the bridge connecting the two treatments."

Each line (edge) between nodes represents studies that directly compared those two treatments (direct comparison).\nThe magic of NMA is that it synthesizes all available evidence into a coherent framework.

Notice how placebo sits at the center, connecting to most treatments. This is typical since many trials compare a new treatment against placebo. The lines between treatments represent direct head-to-head comparisons from clinical trials.\nSometimes researchers have both direct evidence and indirect evidence for the same comparison. NMA combines them mathematically to get the most precise estimate possible. This combination of direct and indirect evidence is called mixed treatment comparison.\nMixed treatment comparison uses weighted averages. Larger sampled studies with less variability contribute more to the final estmation. Most modern NMA uses Bayesian statistics to quantify uncertainty and provide an estimation. This allows researchers to say things like “there’s a 96% chance Treatment A is the most effective.”."

    "text": "Case Study: Ranking Hair Loss Treatments\nIn 2022, Gupta and colleagues published a NMA in JAMA Dermatology (Gupta et al. 2022). They wanted to answer exactly this question, “Among minoxidil, finasteride, and dutasteride, which works best for male pattern hair loss?”.\nThey took data from 23 clinical trials spanning several decades. The studies looked at different doses and formulations of the following treatments:\n\nOral dutasteride at 0.5 mg/day\nOral finasteride at 1 mg/day and 5 mg/day\nTopical minoxidil in 2% and 5% solutions\nOral minoxidil at 0.25 mg/day and 5 mg/day\nPlacebo\n\nMost studies compared a single treatment to placebo and only a few went head-to-head.

    "text": "Under the Hood\nAt its core, NMA relies on the consistency assumption which states that the indirect estimate should match up with the direct estimate when you have both available.\nSuppose, Study 1 shows A beats placebo by 10 units. Study 2 shows B beats placebo by 6 units. The indirect math says A beats B by 4 units. If a third study directly compares A and B and finds A wins by 4 units, we’ve got consistency.\nHere’s roughly how the statistical model works.\nFirst, you define treatment effects. Each treatment gets an effect estimate relative to a common reference, usually placebo.\nThen, you combine direct and indirect evidence. When both exist for a comparison, they get combined using inverse-variance weighting. More precise estimates from larger studies carry more weight.\nNext, you estimate uncertainty. Bayesian methods give you not just point estimates but full probability distributions. So you know how confident to be in each ranking.\nFinally, you rank the treatments. There’s a metric called SUCRA, Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking Curve. It summarizes the probability that each treatment is best, second-best, third-best, and so on. A SUCRA of 100% means the treatment is definitely best and 0% means it’s definitely worst.\nThe Gupta study ran 200,000 iterations of Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling. That’s a lot of computation to make sure the results were stable."

They want to know which one to buy.\nNetwork meta-analysis gives them something real. A ranking based on all available evidence. Not marketing. Not one cherry-picked study.\nBefore this analysis, you might read one study showing finasteride works. Another showing minoxidil works. And you’d have no way to compare them. The NMA pulls together decades of clinical research into a clear order.\n\nDutasteride 0.5 mg/day (most effective)\nFinasteride 5 mg/day\nOral minoxidil 5 mg/day\nFinasteride 1 mg/day (the FDA-approved dose)\nTopical minoxidil 5%\nTopical minoxidil 2%\nOral minoxidil 0.25 mg/day\n\nThis ranking is useful for patients and doctors to make informed decisions. It also shows gaps in the evidence, for example, dutasteride’s long-term efficacy at 48 weeks was not well-studied. This gives researchers a clear direction for future research."

    "section": "The Limitations",
    "text": "The Limitations\nNetwork meta-analysis isn’t magic. It depends on some key assumptions holding up.\nTransitivity: The studies being combined need to be similar enough that indirect comparisons make sense. If Study 1 enrolled young patients and Study 2 enrolled elderly patients, comparing their results through a common placebo might mislead you.\nConsistency: When you have both direct and indirect evidence, they should roughly agree. Big inconsistencies suggest problems with assumptions.\nPublication bias: If negative studies never get published, your network only includes treatments that looked like they worked. That can inflate the effectiveness estimates.\nThe Gupta study dealt with these issues. They assessed study quality using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. They evaluated network-wide evidence quality using the CINeMA framework. Gupta found that the evidence quality ranged from low to moderate for most comparisons. This is a common finding in NMA which reflects the imperfect nature of real-world clinical evidence."

Rankings you can actually act on.\nTreatments can be compared indirectly through common reference points. That lets us answer questions no single trial could handle such as, “Which of these many treatments is actually best?”.\nFor hair loss, Gupta’s 2022 analysis gave a clear answer, oral dutasteride leads with higher-dose finasteride coming in next with topical minoxidil trailing behind. This NMA study is not the final word. New head-to-head trials will come along, the network will grow and estimates will become more precise.\nThe next time you are facing a decision with multiple options and conflicting evidence, look for a network meta-analysis. It might cut through the noise and show you what the data actually says."

It should include the following information about the person:\n\nTheir experience. How much experience do they have with your subject, and of what kind?\nTheir motivation. Why do they want to learn about this subject? If they have any specific goals, what are they?\n\nFor example, here are three personas for potential audiences of an explanation of quantum computing:\n\nMike is a third-grade student. He has fairly little experience with any computers at all, let alone quantum computers. But he suspects that computers might be able to help his with tough homework problems, and wants to know if this is true of quantum computers.\nNadine is a fifteen-year-old high school student. She is familiar with computers; most commonly she uses her iPhone to socialize, study, and take photoes. She has never heard of quantum computers before, but likes to impress her friends with cool facts about things she learns.\nAlex is an undergraduate computer science student interested in machine learning and artificial intelligence. They taken courses in chemistry and physics, and knows the basics of how quantum computing differs from classical computing. They are curious about the kinds of problems that quantum computing could be used to solve, and how soon the technology might become commercially available.\n\nWrite an audience persona for the target reader of your blog that is 3-5 sentences long. Additionally, propose a minimum of 3 different titles for your blog. During the lab, we encourage you to exchange the audience persona, the titles, and the abstract with your peers and get their initial feedback.\n\nAnswer: Question 1\n\nPersona\n\nJohn Smith is a twenty-five-year-old working professional. John has noticed some gradual hair loss over the last 2-3 years and recently decided to research his options. After looking for possible treatments online, he found himself overwheled by conflicting information about what is the most effective, from ads claiming Rogaine to be the most effective, to articles about “breakthrough” interventions. John knows nothing about Data Science/Statistics but is enthusiastic to learn so that he can make an informed decision. He is curious to learn how to evaluate the results on hair loss studies himself rather than to trust marketing/anecdotes from forums.\n\n\n\nPotential Titles:\n\nWhat Your Pharmacy Shelves Won’t Tell You About Hair Loss Treatment\nWhy the Most Advertised Hair Loss Treatment Isn’t the Most Effective\nThe Hair Loss Treatments Your Doctor Knows About (But Ads Won’t Show You)\nA Beginner’s Guide to Hair Loss: Causes, Treatments, and What Actually Works"

Minoxidil is available over-the-counter, so companies can market directly to consumers. Dutasteride and finasteride require prescriptions, which means less direct advertising and less consumer awareness.\nThe takeaway is simple: the products you see advertised most aren’t necessarily the most effective. If you’re serious about results, it’s worth having a conversation with a doctor about all your options, including prescription treatments."
